# Welcome to the Sprite Shop!
    
In this shop a customer is a king. So you can literally customise everything you want. In this playground book you will be free to change animation with SpriteKit actions.
     
Let's start! Press **Run my code** to see the shop's main page.

## 1. The button Start shopping

Oh, no! It's pulsing. Does it annoy you? Or don't you want to make the button blink? You decide!
---
* Change *by* parameter to 1.0 to stop a button scaling. Or change to 0.0 to make it disappear.ðŸŽ© Is the font too small? Let's make the button bigger by setting *by* to *2.0*.
* **Hint**. If you want the button change the size faster, set *duration* parameter to 0.5.

    let scaleUp = scaleDown.reversed()
//: Mix 2 actions in a sequence to have an amazing effect: the button becomes smaller and after that returns to its normal size.

If you are done, please, press the **Run my code** button. Enjoy your custom animation!


## 2. A special offer

I suspect that you already tried to press the button *Start shopping*. If not, try it now.
You are lucky! I have a special offer for you. If you create one t-shirt, you will get as many as you wish. Just type in the number here. Run the code to see your offer!
