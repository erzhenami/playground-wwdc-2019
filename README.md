# Sprite Shop
The Sprite Shop is a playground where you can style your personal T-shirt and practice SpriteKit actions. You can customise the size, colour and text of a T-shirt which is saved as a JPG file. In this playground I also used these basic frameworks: Foundation, UIKit, PlaygroundSupport and CoreGraphics.

I decided to take this topic because I am really passionate about e-commerce. A week ago I knew almost nothing about SpriteKit and decided that it could be a great challenge to build a playground to apply for a scholarship and at the same time start to learn this framework. 

- You can try basic SKActions and combine to get a complex actions.
- In Intro page I tried to imitate typical online shop webpage. On every page you will find a call to action button.
- The playground automatically calculates your size based on the breast measurement. 
- Text colour on a T-shirt is complimentary so it's always legible. 
- For scissors I used a special animation - they follow a custom UIBezierPath.
- Sounds are also SpriteKit actions. You can choose a sound of scissors by typing in one of the words.
- The t-shirt image is saved on the disk so you can share it with friends or keep for memory.

As it's a playground, for better experience please tap Run My Code button immediately after opening a new page in a landscape mode. Hope that you will like it!
